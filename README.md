# Customer-Feedback-Sentiment-Analyzer 

🚀 Project Overview :

This project analyzes customer reviews and automatically classifies them into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.  It helps businesses understand customer opinions, identify complaints, and improve products/services based on feedback. The system processes raw text data, performs cleaning and feature extraction, and uses a Logistic Regression model with TF-IDF vectorization to accurately predict the sentiment of unseen reviews. In addition to classification, the project also performs text analytics and visualization, such as sentiment distribution, most frequent complaint words, and customer behavior insights, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

🎯 Objectives : 

- Perform sentiment classification on customer reviews
- Clean and preprocess raw text data
- Extract meaningful insights from feedback
- Visualize sentiment distribution
- Identify most frequent negative and positive words
